My full name is Albert Llonch de Prado. I'm a Spanish software engineer working full time in the software industry. Happily maintaining a relationship for over 6 years now.

This site will try to be my personal space in the Internet, hopefully to share regularly the things I am working on and thoughts.

The site is build with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io), and deployed throguh Github pages in [my personal repo](https://github.com/albertllonch/albertllonch.github.io).
