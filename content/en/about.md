My full name is Albert Llonch. I'm a Spanish software engineer working full time in the software industry. Happily maintaining a relationship for over 7 years now, with a baby on the way.

This site will try to be my personal space in the Internet, hopefully to share regularly my thoughts and the work I do. I like coding, 3d printing, ham radio and microcontrollers.

The site is build with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io), and deployed throguh Github pages in [my personal repo](https://github.com/albertllonch/albertllonch.github.io).
